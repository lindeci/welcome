/**
  @file

  This file implements the DPhyp algorithm for enumerating connected
  subgraphs of hypergraphs (see hypergraph.h for a hypergraph definition).

  The core idea of the algorithm is that if the join structure of a
  query is expressed as a hypergraph, where the relations are nodes
  and the join predicates are hyperedges, one can efficiently find
  all legal join orders without Cartesian products by finding all
  possible subpartitions of the hypergraph. (Simple inner joins will
  have regular edges, but outer joins, antijoins etc., can be encoded
  as hyperedges to constrain the allowed join orderings, so that we
  do not join e.g. an inner and outer table together before said inner
  table has been joined to the entire set. Also, hyper-predicates such
  as t1.a + t2.b = t3.c will naturally give rise to hyperedges.)

  The algorithm is described in the paper “Dynamic Programming Strikes
  Back” by Neumann and Moerkotte. There is a somewhat extended version
  of the paper (that also contains a few corrections) in Moerkotte's
  treatise “Building Query Compilers”. Some critical details are still
  missing, which we've had to fill in ourselves. We don't currently
  implement the extension to generalized hypergraphs, but it should be
  fairly straightforward to do later. The algorithm is simple in concept
  but hard to grasp; we will only give a very rough outline here:

    1. Pick a seed node of the graph.
    2. Grow that seed along hyperedges, taking care never to make an
       unconnected graph or seeing the same subgraph twice.
    3. For each connected subgraph (csg): Repeat steps 1–2 independently
       to create a separate connected subgraph (the so-called complement,
       cmp), and try to connect the subgraph and its complement to create
       a larger graph (a so-called csg-cmp-pair).
    4. When such a csg-cmp-pair is found, call the receiver back with the
       csg and cmp. This is a valid subjoin that can be costed.

  The entry point for doing this is EnumerateAllConnectedPartitions().

  For complex joins, we may have to run DPhyp multiple times in a mode
  where we just count the number of partitions over various constrained
  graphs, and this will be a critical part of query planning time.
  Thus, it is coded as a template over a receiver type that gets callbacks
  for each partition. If the receiver just interested in counting,
  this saves a significant amount of call overhead. The templatization
  also allows the microbenchmarks to more accurately measure changes in
  the algorithm itself without having to benchmark the receiver.

  FindNeighborhood() (see below) is crucial for speed. We can speed it up
  somewhat by observing that it is often being called many times with the
  same forbidden set and subgraphs that keep increasing; e.g., when we
  have the neighborhood {R1,R2}, we need to calculate the neighborhood of
  {R1}, {R2} and {R1,R2} -- the latter will start with calculating the
  neighborhood of {R1} and then add {R2} from there. We cannot just union
  the two neighborhoods due to hyperedges, but we can reuse the start.

  To this end, NeighborhoodCache implements a simple one-element cache.
  If we start a neighborhood computation that is a superset of the element
  in the cache, we can just continue with the neighborhood it calculated
  and add the missing elements. The overhead of managing the cache is a
  ~15-20% loss for simple graphs with low degrees (e.g. chains), but a
  huge speedup (60% or more) for graphs with high degrees, such as stars.
  Given that the simple graphs are already so fast that their time is
  hardly noticeable, this seems like a good overall tradeoff.

  The default enumeration of power sets given by NonzeroSubsetsOf
  (e.g. 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, etc. for three nodes in the neighborhood)
  is not optimal for caching. E.g., for four bits, we can brute-force the
  optimal order to be

    0001 *0010 0011 *0100 0101 *0110 0111 1110 *1000 1010 1100 *1001
    1011 *1110 1111

  where we overwrite the element in the cache every time we process a subset
  marked by *. This yields an optimal 17 loop iterations saved, leaving only 15.
  However, it is not clear how to efficiently enumerate these orders and choice
  of elements to cache realtime without huge precalculated tables (e.g., what is
  the optimal order for 14 potential neighbors?), so instead, we keep the normal
  order and add a simple heuristic: Keep every other item. The lowest bit will
  change between 0 and 1 every iteration, so one that ends in 1 cannot possibly
  be a subset of the the next enumerated subset. This yields:

    0001 *0010 0011 *0100 0101 *0110 0111 *1000 1001 *1010 1011 *1100
    1101 *1110 1111

  which saves 16 loop iterations, nearly as good. (This pattern does not seem
  to change markedly for larger subsets; the best pattern for five bits is
  1 *2 3 6 *10 11 14 *4 *5 7 21 *13 15 *8 9 12 *24 25 26 *28 29 30 *16 17 20
  *18 22 *19 23 *27 31, saving 49 bits where the heuristic saves 44. Optimal
  patterns for more than five bits are not known.)

  The only thing that really matters is keeping track of what the lowest bit
  is; we call it the “taboo bit”, as when we process such a subset, it
  signals that the result shouldn't replace whatever is in the cache.

  Note that you cannot reuse the cache across calls with different forbidden
  subsets; that would yield wrong results.

/**
  Find the neighborhood of the given subgraph (S); informally, the set of nodes
  immediately reachable from that subgraph. There's an additional constraint
  in that the edges used to do so must not touch the forbidden set of nodes (X).
  The DPhyp paper calls this function N(S, X) (with a calligraphic N).

  How to calculate the neighborhood efficiently is one of the least explicitly
  described parts of the paper. The definition goes about as follows:

    1. Find E↓'(S,X), the set of “interesting hypernodes” (outgoing edge
       destinations from S). These are the (endpoints of) edges that have one
       side entirely within S, that have the other side entirely _outside_ S,
       and none of the sides touch the forbidden set X.
    2. Minimize E↓'(S,X) by removing all “subsumed hypernodes”, giving E↓(S,X).
       u subsumes v if it is a proper subset; if so, we can never go to where v
       points to before we've been at u, so it's pointless to keep v.
    3. For each hypernode in E↓(S,X), pick node with lowest index as a
       representative, because our subset enumeration algorithms cannot
       enumerate subsets of hypernodes, only subsets of normal nodes.
       (Actually, any node that's part of the hypernode would do; it does not
       even need to be consistent.) These nodes together constitute the
       neighborhood.

  There are a couple of points to note here:

  First, adding more nodes than needed to the neighborhood does not affect
  correctness of the algorithm, only speed. We try all combinations of
  included/excluded for the neighborhood (2^N in the number of nodes),
  so this covers all potential subgraphs; in theory, we could even just choose
  all non-forbidden nodes and reduce to the algorithm known as DPhyp, it just
  wouldn't be very efficient.

  Second, step 3 means that we may very well end up with a non-connected
  subgraph. This is harmless; we may eventually grow it to a connected one or
  we may not, we just won't start looking for any complements until we have a
  connected one (and we know whether it's connected or not based on whether we
  saw it as a csg-cmp pair in the algorithm earlier).

  Third, due to the way we grow our subgraph, only the nodes that we have just
  grown by can contribute to the E↓'(S,X). The reason is simple; every node
  from the previous neighborhood will have been added either to S or to X,
  and both exclude them from the new neighborhood. (Step 2 doesn't affect this,
  as any hypernode that was subsumed would also have to touch S or X.
  But there's an exception in that occasionally, we can remove nodes from X;
  see ExpandSubgraph().)

  Fourth, perfect minimization seems to be impossible to actually implement
  efficiently. This is known as the minimum set problem, and the best known
  algorithms to do this are in O(n² / log n) time (see e.g. Pritchard: ”An Old
  Sub-Quadratic Algorithm for Finding Extremal Sets”), which can be quite a
  lot when there are lots of edges. (The trivial O(n²) algorithm is to just test
  every set against every smaller set, and throw it out if it's a superset.)
  Since loops in our hypergraphs are presumed to be fairly rare, it would not
  seem worth it to do full minimization.

  Instead, we pick the low-hanging fruit only: Every _simple_ edge is trivial
  to test against. We just collect the simple edges into a mask, and any
  (complex) hyperedge that overlaps with that bitmap can immediately be
  discarded. Even more, since we don't have to pick min(S) but can pick
  something arbitrary, we can let {R2,R3} (which gets R2 as its representative
  node) subsume {R1,R2}, even though it's not an actual subset, by pretending
  we picked R2 as the representative node for the latter! This is similar to
  what Moerkotte describes in his “Building Query Compilers” document,
  which seems to contain a slightly extended version of the DPhyp paper
  (under a different name). We could have collected all the simple edges in a
  separate pass first, but the microbenchmarks show that the added loop overhead
  isn't worth it.

  Note that we also keep E↓'(S,X), the set of interesting hypernodes; we
  bitwise-or it into “full_neighborhood”. This is useful later when searching
  for edges to connect the connected subgraph and its complement; we know that
  only edges into “full_neighborhood” can connect the two.

  This function accounts for roughly 20–70% of the total DPhyp running time,
  depending on the shape of the graph (~40% average across the microbenchmarks).
  It is fairly big to inline, but it helps speed significantly, probably due
  to the large amount of parameters to be passed back and forth.
